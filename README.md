Express base boilerplate  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Alevardi/express-base-boilerplate.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Alevardi/express-base-boilerplate)
========

This is a starter boilerplate to start building [node.js](http://nodejs.org) `>=v0.8` with [express](http://expressjs.com)
apps within seconds, bringing together the trend technologies in node world development such as:

* [Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) (less & javascripts) `v2.3.1`
* [Express](http://Expressjs.com) `3.1.1`
* [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) `0.28.2`
* [angular.js](http://angularjs.org/) `1.0.6`
* [jquery](http://jquery.com/) `1.9.1`

Created and mantained by [Amet Alvirde](http://twitter.com/Alevardi). Free software, as always.

## Current Version v1.0.0
v1.0.0 fires up an application ready to tweak and modify in order to suit your project, with the
technologies listed up.

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
